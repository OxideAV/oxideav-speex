# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the crate adheres
to [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ogg/Speex stream-header packet parser per *The Speex Codec Manual*
  §7.3 (Table 7.1): `SpeexHeader::parse(buf)` validates the
  `b"Speex   "` magic and decodes all 13 little-endian `int32` fields
  plus the `speex_version` ASCII string. Surfaces typed
  `HeaderError::TooShort` / `HeaderError::BadMagic` for malformed
  inputs.
- Public constants `SPEEX_MAGIC`, `SPEEX_HEADER_LEN` (80), and the
  three documented mode IDs `SPEEX_MODE_NARROWBAND` /
  `SPEEX_MODE_WIDEBAND` / `SPEEX_MODE_ULTRAWIDEBAND` for downstream
  consumers.
- Seven unit tests covering NB / WB / UWB synthetic headers, bad
  magic, short buffers, trailing-byte tolerance, and exhaustive
  field-order mapping against Table 7.1.

### Erased

- Prior master history was force-erased on **2026-05-19** under
  Hat-3 cold enforcement of the workspace clean-room policy
  (`docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md`).

### Reset

- Crate reduced to a minimal `oxideav_core::register!` stub. Every
  public API returns `Error::NotImplemented`. The crates.io version
  (`0.0.6`) is preserved on the new master to avoid breaking
  downstream version pins; the published versions on crates.io will
  be yanked by the maintainer.
- The `oxideav-ogg` dev-dependency (used by the prior integration
  test) is dropped from the scaffold and will be re-introduced in a
  future round if needed.

### Next

- Clean-room re-implementation of the CELP frame decoder against the
  published Speex specifications + RFC 5574 in subsequent rounds.
